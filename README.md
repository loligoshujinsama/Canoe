Overhaul to codes:
  1. only run Website.py to host all, instead of running all display python files concurrently
  2. prophet is set to forecast to 1 December 2023. Only one-time run.
  3. NLP is active, output as <Airline_name>.png file



To-do:
  2. Hotel scraping to only activate after user click 'Hotel Suggestions'
  3. homepage to include F1 schedule inputs. Source is SIN by default
  4. Need to reference to full name of location (e.g. BKK should map to BANGKOK)
  5. Implement the wordcloud .png files to display to user
  6. Loading screen (OPTIONAL)
  7. Hotel_suggestion page should contain hotel name, and wordcloud of hotel rating
  8. Changed 10 days to 7 days instead. <b>IMPT: when user selects the race date, need to be 7 days BEFORE. Currently taking in 7 days AFTER.</b>

Idea - List down all the involved airlines. User click, will show the wordcloud for THAT airline, instead of wordclouding ALL airlines. (take some time)
Put loading screen ahaha.
